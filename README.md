# Oriented-Object-Project
with a non OO language (in C here as example)

This program is an example to show the differents ways to achieve the POO features brought internally by the C++ layer but with C hacks.

class and Inheritance, overloading, polymorphism, interface, class reflexivity, packaging and namespace... all of theses features except operator overloading are set and working.

run the example with gcc at the last version, because some of theses extensions are used on it.

Both works on Linux and Windows. No memory leaks guaranteed thanks the listing of the instance in a chained list.
